# Load-balancing-of-bike-fleet
This project was given as a subject in my master degree in data science. I will be studying an optimization problem related to the management of a self-service bicycle (SSB) fleet in a city. The company in charge of the fleet wants to balance the bike stations at night by sending a trailer to visit different stations and adjust the number of bikes at each station to its ideal level. The goal is to minimize the global imbalance, defined as the sum of the imbalances of each station, and, among all the possible tours that minimize the global imbalance, to minimize the distance traveled by the trailer. To solve this problem, I will propose a mathematical model and use the Julia programming language, with the JuMP library and a free integer linear programming (ILP) solver (Cbc), to solve small instances and show its limits, then implement a heuristic and a metaheurtic method to solve larger instances, and finally I will determine the lower bounds of the imbalances of all the instances by modifying the model written for the exact solution in order to compute the continuous relaxation of the problem. The lower bound will then be useful to evaluate the quality of the two heuristic methods.
